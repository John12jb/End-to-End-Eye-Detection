Eye Detection System in Python

A modular and extensible eye detection system built using Python and OpenCV.
The pipeline follows a structured approach: face detection first, then eye localization within detected face regions to improve accuracy and reduce false positives.

This project supports both static images and real-time webcam input, and includes a minimal working script as well as a fully documented extended version.
