# End-to-End-Eye-Detection
A modular eye detection system built with Python and OpenCV. The pipeline detects faces first, then localizes eyes within each region to improve accuracy and reduce false positives. Supports images and real-time webcam input, includes preprocessing, confidence handling, and both a minimal MVP and an extensible version.
